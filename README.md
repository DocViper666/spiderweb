### Ham radio cluster web viewer for DxSpider

**Author:** Corrado Gerbaldo - IU1BOW.  
**Mail:** <corrado.gerbaldo@gmail.com>  
**Version:** Beta    
**Last update:** 09/02/2020    
**Licensing:** Gpl V3.0 see ["LICENSE"](LICENSE) file.   
**OS:** This application is written in Python/flask,Javascript and HTML 

This application connects to a dx cluster telnet server and shows all spots received from the remote server.  
You could apply continents and bands filters.
When you choose a filter, it is applied only on the list showed, but meanhile GDX continue to receive all spots from the remote server, so when you'll remove the filter you could show all spots received.

For this application I've used:
- **Bootstrap** for stylesheet CSS
- **Fontawesone** I used it for icons
- **Jquery** In the header you can find the link to MS link
- **qrz.com** For each callsing found you can click on lens and you'll see him on qrz.com
- **www.countryflags.io** I used it for show the country flags

### Install and configuration
